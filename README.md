1. Add A button which says 'Display Details'

3. Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number)
4. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (ngClass)
